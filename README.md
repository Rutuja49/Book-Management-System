# Book-Management-System

This project implements a Book Management System in C++ to manage a collection of books. It provides functionalities like adding, removing, updating, and searching for books by attributes such as author or category. The program also displays the top 3 books based on price and rating and allows listing all stored books. It uses a struct to represent books and manages them dynamically in a fixed-size array.
